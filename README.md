# Poke Prices
Dust off those old card binders! Pokemon card prices are crazy right now. Using the <a href="https://pokemontcg.io/">Weatherdbi API</a> I created an app to let the user search for any Pokemon card and see the price.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS

Using OOP classes, the information is pulled from the api and appended to the DOM. The price information is mainuplated using array methods. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project allowed me to work on my Tailwind CSS skills, furthered my knowledge with OOP, and make me regret not keeping good care of my Pokemon cards.
